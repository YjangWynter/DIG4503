# Exercise 2
This software recreates the Unova Pokedex, by running a script which randomly selects a Pokemon via the PokeAPI.
This program pulls the pokemons' sprite, name, ida, type, abilities, and other data.
What makes this different from my previous work is that this project will eventually become a Pokedex with an UI will be created and a button will be created to randomly select another pokemon. For now it uses chalk because I can't figure out how to export Promised-based functional components
